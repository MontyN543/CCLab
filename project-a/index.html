                    <li> The main body also shapes violently when aggravated. </li>
                    <li> The antenna can also move on it's own sometimes.</li>

                Ozirith came to be from a wartime transmission that was never received. Stuck in an endless loop, it searches for a listener to complete its purpose. It reacts strangely to old frequencies, replaying fragments of unknown voices, as if hoping someone will finally respond. 
                
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Turning to specific frequencies changes Ozirithâ€™s behavior, and the frequency it projects, but turning too much will engage the creature. Some believe aligning the dial perfectly will reveal its undelivered message, but no one has fully deciphered it yet.
